                <p className=' text-xs text-cyan-600 my-2'> 
                Refresh tokens allow you to balance your users' access needs with your organization's security practices. Access tokens help users get the resources they need to complete their tasks, but such tokens can also expose your organization to data compromise or other malicious actions if a hacker is able to steal them. <br />
                s the name suggests, client-side storage allows the user to store data on the client. <br />

                Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?

                <p className='text-xs text-cyan-600 my-2'>
                SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON

                <p className='text-xs text-cyan-600 my-2'>
                In MongoDB, aggregation operations process the data records/documents and return computed results. 
                MongoDB provides aggregation operations through aggregation pipelines â€” a series of operations that process data documents sequentially
